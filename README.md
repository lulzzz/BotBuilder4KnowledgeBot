# BotBuilder V4 Knowledge Bot
An example of a knowledge bot built with the Bot Builder SDK V4 preview for C#.
The bot uses a combination of LUIS, QnA maker and Azure Search to answer the user's question and provide links to documents
in Azure Storage. You will have to set up Azure Search with the correct retrievable fields, QnA maker and LUIS first. 
All keys and configuration is done in the appsettings.json file.
